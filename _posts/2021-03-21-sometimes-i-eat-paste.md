I don't actually eat paste. Here's the thing: sometimes the things we don't eat, eat us.

This world demands strange adaptation. It may also demand absurd combinations of strange adaptations.

What do these things have to do with each other? I dunno. I guess I'm trying to figure out how to digest everything and poop out skill. Yes, that will do.

The truth is that I'm an idiot and never went to school for religion or philosophy yet somehow presume to have carved out a little niche of understanding that enables my life. Typical, right?

I actually don't think there's anything wrong with being a smoothbrain as long as you accept that you're a fool. When you accept that you're a fool, the futility of trying to have everything dialed-in all the time becomes immediately apparent.

The absurd becomes a new frontier.

And that's where I'm hanging out, eating paste (wait, I mean, NOT eating paste!), and trying to figure out how to be a damn mammal fish frog with poison claws and bioluminescence in this weird-ass terrain.
